# AI-MUSICWORLD Web Platform

## Overview
AI-MUSICWORLD is a platform for AI-generated rock music where real bands reinterpret AI songs and the public votes on their favorites. The best entries rise through the AI-HITPARADE, and—with the artists’ permission—can be submitted to radio and TV stations.

## Project Structure
- `index.html` – Welcome page
- `login.html` – Login page (upload access)
- `register.html` – User registration
- `passwort-vergessen.html` – Password reset
- `partner.html` – Info for media & promotional partners

## Goal
This platform is intended to be extended with Supabase:
- User authentication (register, login, password recovery)
- Media uploads (audio, video)
- Voting / rating system
- Hitparade result storage and display

## Notes
All pages are static HTML with inline CSS.
Supabase can be integrated using JS SDK or any modern frontend framework.
